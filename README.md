# Photo Sphere Browser

## Intro
This is a photo sphere browser and viewer. It scans a local folder for photo-sphere files and diplays them in a icon grid similar to Windows Explorer.

The browser/viewer supports:
* browsing folder structure
* sphere viewer (via https://github.com/knee-cola/SphereViewer)
* multiple navigation options
	* via clicking on the folder & file icons
	* via clicking on path links at the top of the page
	* via editing URL in browser's address bar
	* via clicking back & forward browser button (full browsing history is supported)
