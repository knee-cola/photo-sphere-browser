# Photo Sphere Browser

## Intro
This is a photo sphere browser and viewer. It scans a local folder for photo-sphere files and diplays them in a icon grid similar to Windows Explorer.

The browser/viewer supports:
* browsing folder structure
* access a folder or file directly by typing/pasting it's URL into browser adress box
* back/forward navigation - use back & forward button to navigate back to previously viewed folder or file
* sphere viewer
